#  **Simple TicTacToe Project**

---

### **_About this project:_**
As a new person to Python, I want to create a simple program that I will keep upgrading and improving, as I learn more Python       programming. I will document every change I'll make, and use it as a documentation on my development in learning Python.

### **_About the code:_**
The source code of this project includes a lot of comments. I have commented the code, but keep in mind that English isnâ€™t my primary language. Therefore, there may be some mistakes in the comments, but I'll only wrote the comments for myself. Therefore, some comments may not make sense at all. As I improve my programming, the code will be improved as best as possible.
